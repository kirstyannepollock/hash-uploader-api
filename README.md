# hash-uploader-api
Back end nodejs exercise

Was roughly tested using Postman - see [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/e1060a6cd93cf1b38b71)
Only a demo, uses a js map as a datastore, only storing the file names and hashes, so not so very bad. In reality one would probably use a database.

I am missing the installation instructions asked for in the question  - I have never deployed a nodejs app, I believe they can be packaged to be standalone.
